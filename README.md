Lavasa – A Climate Blind Spot
A collaborative project by students of CHRIST University, Bengaluru, created for the NASA Space Apps Challenge. This project explores Lavasa’s overlooked ecological issues through interactive visualizations, satellite‑based timelines, and narrative‑driven analysis. With CHRIST University also having a campus in Lavasa, this work serves as an awareness initiative for our own community—highlighting the importance of environmental accountability close to home.

🌍 About the Project
Lavasa’s rapid development and subsequent ecological decline remain largely absent from mainstream climate datasets. Our project reframes this absence as a climate blind spot, using data storytelling and visual analysis to make the issue more visible and understandable.

✨ Key Features
Interactive Dashboard – Visualizes timelines, environmental patterns, and key events

Satellite Imagery Analysis – Tracks terrain and land‑use changes over time

Narrative Storytelling – Presents the issue through a documentary‑style flow

Awareness‑Driven Design – Built to inform and engage CHRIST University’s Lavasa community
